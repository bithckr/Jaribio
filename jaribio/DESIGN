Test Cases - consists of steps to execute and expectations
Test Plans - a grouping of one or more test cases
Issues - issues represent some foreign resource for which there should be
a test plan; so these could be new features, improvements, or bugs

Additionally, we want to also store the results of executing a test plan, 
marking a test case as pass, fail, with a default value indicating the
test case was not executed.

A test plan can be executed multiple times.

Executed Test Plan - the stored results of executing a test plan

== Data Model

test_cases

has_many :executions, :as => :executable

suites
id|user_id|name|timestamps
has_many :executions, :as => :executable

plans
id|user_id|name|timestamps
has_many :executions, :as => :executable

test_cases_suites - relation table for test case to/from test suite
test_case_id|suite_id

plans_suites - relation table for test suite to/from test plan
plan_id|suite_id

issues
id|name|url

issues_suites - relation table for issues to/from test suites
issue_id|suite_id

executions - record information about executing a plan, suite, or test case
id|executable_id|executable_type|user_id|timestamps|status_code|environment|results

users
- using devise standard schema here

Supported queries necessary to Jaribio:
* List of test cases
* List of test plans
* List of test cases within a test plan
* List of test cases for an issue
* Current status of a test case
* Status of each test case for each time it was executed for a given test plan

* Who created a case
* Who associated a case to a plan
* Who associated a case to an issue
* Who has executed a case

TODO:
* Should probably have some means of describing environments other than
text; discuss with team.

== Authentication

Integration with Jira

Jira includes a REST API for authentication, /auth/1/session.
The goal here is to be able to let a user login with Jira credentials
if they choose and for Jaribio to use the resulting session id from
Jira to provide additional functionality.

After some investigation it does not appear one can easily include
single sign on with Jira. :(  So for now, users will just have to login
to this application as well.
