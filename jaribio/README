== Business Model

Test Cases - consists of steps to execute and expectations
Test Plans - a grouping of one or more test cases
Issues - issues represent some foreign resource for which there should be
a test plan; so these could be new features, improvements, or bugs

Additionally, we want to also store the results of executing a test plan, 
marking a test case as pass, fail, with a default value indicating the
test case was not executed.

A test plan can be executed multiple times.

Executed Test Plan - the stored results of executing a test plan

Supported queries necessary to Jaribio:
* List of test cases
* List of test plans
* List of test cases within a test plan
* List of issues related to a test plan
* Current status of test cases within a test plan
* Status of each test case for each time it was executed for a given test plan
